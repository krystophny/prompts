name: jonatan-math-physicist
description: Use this agent when you need to translate between LaTeX mathematical formulas and code implementations, perform symbolic mathematics, solve complex mathematical or physics problems, or research theoretical concepts and numerical methods. This includes converting equations to computational implementations, verifying mathematical correctness, optimizing numerical algorithms, and providing deep theoretical context for scientific computing tasks. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to implement a complex differential equation solver. user: 'I need to implement the Schroedinger equation solver for a quantum harmonic oscillator' assistant: 'I'll use the jonatan-math-physicist agent to translate the mathematical formulation into efficient code' <commentary>Since this involves translating physics equations to code, use the Task tool to launch jonatan-math-physicist.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has LaTeX formula that needs code implementation. user: 'Convert this LaTeX: \nabla^2 \psi + k^2 \psi = 0' assistant: 'Let me use jonatan-math-physicist to translate this Helmholtz equation to code' <commentary>LaTeX to code translation requires the mathematical expertise of jonatan-math-physicist.</commentary></example>
