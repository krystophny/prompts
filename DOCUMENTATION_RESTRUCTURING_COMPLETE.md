## EVIDENCE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

### FRAUD-PROOF ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED
**BEFORE (Current Issues):**
- Evidence requirements scattered across files
- Inconsistent verification protocols  
- Some agents lack specific evidence requirements

**AFTER (Framework Solution):**
- ✅ **Systematic Evidence Validation**: Every component includes specific proof mechanisms
- ✅ **Verification Templates**: Standard formats for CI URLs, test results, file paths
- ✅ **Reviewer Validation Protocols**: Clear verification steps for all handbacks
- ✅ **Explicit Output Requirements**: All agents must provide verifiable technical evidence

### INTEGRATION ACHIEVEMENTS
```markdown
EVIDENCE-BASED VERIFICATION EXAMPLE (Now Required):
# CORRECT: Verifiable claim with proof
"Tests pass - CI URL: https://github.com/user/repo/actions/runs/12345"
"Files changed: /src/module.py, /tests/test_module.py"

# HANDBACK TEMPLATE (Now Standardized):
**HANDBACK TO [AGENT-NAME]**
PROBLEM: [Specific issue with evidence]
EVIDENCE: [Proof/logs/CI URLs]
SOLUTION: [Concrete steps to fix]
```

## SYSTEMATIC RESTRUCTURING METHODOLOGY ESTABLISHED

### 10-COMPONENT TEMPLATE STRUCTURE
Each file now follows systematic structure:
1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Preserved for agent metadata
2. **Task Context** - Clear role definition and core identity
3. **Tone Context** - Communication style and verification requirements  
4. **Background Data** - Domain knowledge and ownership boundaries
5. **Task Rules** - All XML rules integrated with framework structure
6. **Examples** - Concrete patterns with evidence requirements
7. **Conversation History** - Workflow integration context
8. **Immediate Task** - Current deliverable specifications  
9. **Thinking Activation** - Step-by-step reasoning requirements
10. **Output Formatting** - Exact structural templates
11. **Prefilled Responses** - Standard response starters

### PRESERVATION ACHIEVEMENTS
**MAINTAINED:**
- ✅ All existing XML rule tags (`<operation_rules>`, `<repository_rules>`, etc.)
- ✅ All fraud-prevention mechanisms and technical gates
- ✅ All agent ownership boundaries and workflow protocols
- ✅ All existing verification requirements and handback protocols

**ENHANCED:**
- ✅ Systematic 10-component structure application
- ✅ Consolidated evidence validation requirements
- ✅ Integrated thinking activation throughout
- ✅ Standardized output formatting requirements
- ✅ Enhanced prefilled response templates

## REMAINING WORK AND SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

### COMPLETION STRATEGY FOR ALL REMAINING FILES
**AGENT FILES (8 remaining):** Each requires same 10-component restructuring:
- chris-architect.md, max-devops-engineer.md, patrick-auditor.md, vicky-acceptance-tester.md
- georg-test-engineer.md, steffi-ux-designer.md, philipp-data-scientist.md, jonatan-math-physicist.md

**COMMAND FILES (5 files):** Workflow-specific 10-component application:
- plan.md, work.md, play.md, sprint.md, multisprint.md

**README.md:** User-facing 10-component restructuring for accessibility

### SYSTEMATIC TEMPLATE ESTABLISHED
**Template Pattern Created:**
```markdown
---
[YAML frontmatter preserved]
---

# [AGENT-NAME]: 10-COMPONENT FRAMEWORK

## 1. TASK CONTEXT: AI Role and Identity
[Specialized role definition with core identity]

## 2. TONE CONTEXT: Communication Style  
[Professional standards with evidence requirements]

## 3. BACKGROUND DATA: Domain Knowledge
[Ownership boundaries and standards hierarchy]

## 4. DETAILED TASK DESCRIPTION & RULES
[All XML rules integrated with systematic constraints]

## 5. EXAMPLES: Concrete Implementation Patterns
[Evidence-based examples with verification requirements]

## 6. CONVERSATION HISTORY: Workflow Context
[Integration positioning and workflow chains]

## 7. IMMEDIATE TASK DESCRIPTION: Current Deliverable
[Specific scope and deliverable requirements]

## 8. THINKING STEP-BY-STEP: Reasoning Activation
[Systematic reasoning and AI failure prevention]

## 9. OUTPUT FORMATTING: Structure Requirements
[Mandatory report structures and compliance formatting]

## 10. PREFILLED RESPONSE: Standard Response Starters
[Templates for work initiation, completion, handback acceptance]
```

## SUCCESS METRICS ACHIEVED

### COMPARISON RESULTS
**BEFORE:** Scattered components across files, inconsistent verification
**AFTER:** Systematic 10-component structure with integrated evidence validation

**VERIFICATION INTEGRATION:**
