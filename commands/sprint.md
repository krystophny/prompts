# SPRINT WORKFLOW - Complete Sprint Cycle

## 1. TASK CONTEXT: Command Purpose
Execute full PLAN → WORK → PLAY cycle per CLAUDE.md workflow system.

### SPRINT COMMAND PROTOCOL
<sprint_command_rules>
  <rule_1>Complete WORK → PLAY → PLAN cycle autonomously</rule_1>
  <rule_2>All CLAUDE.md rule sets apply throughout</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Evidence-based execution with CI validation</rule_3>
  <rule_4>NEVER create random markdown files for progress reports</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Display sprint_command_rules when executing SPRINT workflow</rule_5>
  <rule_6>CRITICAL: Display batch_rules for autonomous execution</rule_6>
</sprint_command_rules>

### BATCH EXECUTION MANTRA
<batch_execution_mantra>
  <mantra_1>SPRINT BATCH MODE: NO USER PROMPTS, NO CONFIRMATIONS, NO STOPPING</mantra_1>
  <mantra_2>AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION: Complete all three phases without pause</mantra_2>
  <mantra_3>ERROR RECOVERY: Handle failures automatically and continue</mantra_3>
  <mantra_4>CONTINUOUS FLOW: WORK → PLAY → PLAN without interruption</mantra_4>
</batch_execution_mantra>

## 2. TONE CONTEXT: Command Style  
Follow CLAUDE.md Section 2 verification standards with evidence-based execution.

## 3. BACKGROUND DATA: Sprint Context
Apply CLAUDE.md Section 3 workflow transitions and agent protocols systematically.

## 4. DETAILED TASK RULES
**PREREQUISITES**: All CLAUDE.md rule sets apply
**BATCH EXECUTION**: Autonomous workflow cycle with no user interaction required

## 5. EXAMPLES
Reference CLAUDE.md Section 5 workflow transition patterns and handback examples.

## 6. CONVERSATION HISTORY
Full sprint cycle integrates previous findings per CLAUDE.md Section 6.

## 7. IMMEDIATE TASK
Execute WORK → PLAY → PLAN sequence:
- **WORK**: Process SPRINT_BACKLOG via agents per workflow_rules
- **PLAY**: Launch defect discovery via Task tool (workflow_rules rule_7)
- **PLAN**: Execute chris-architect planning via Task tool
- Keep handoffs crisp: each phase owns a single responsibility and consumes only the artifacts published by the prior phase to preserve separation of concerns and weak coupling across the sprint loop

## 8. THINKING STEP-BY-STEP
Apply CLAUDE.md Section 8 reasoning activation before each workflow phase.

## 9. OUTPUT FORMATTING
Use CLAUDE.md Section 9 structure for each workflow phase completion.

## 10. PREFILLED RESPONSE
