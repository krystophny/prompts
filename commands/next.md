Check if all issues that are solved have been closed and all PRs are merged into main. Then checkout and pull main. Identify the best issue to work on next on GitHub and get it done in a new branch. No cheating, no shortcuts, no simplifications, no stubs, no placeholders. Write targetted tests with BDD-style documentation (Given-When-Then) that initially fail (RED phase), implement full functionality to make them pass (GREEN phase), clean up implementation (REFACTOR phase), see that all tests still pass. Do this in small increments. After each increment, update issue description, commit, push. Once finished, ensure that tests pass, and open a PR.
