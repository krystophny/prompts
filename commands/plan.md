## 4. DETAILED TASK DESCRIPTION: Planning Protocols

## Workflow Trigger Conditions
Execute after PLAY workflow completion OR user planning request.

**FRAUD-PROOF TRIGGER VALIDATION**: Workflow initiation verified through systematic PLAY completion assessment with CI-documented evidence.

**DELEGATION EXECUTION SEQUENCE**:
```
Task tool → chris-architect → Planning Implementation
├── Sprint Transition: Assume current sprint complete
├── Input Gathering: Review ALL GitHub issues from PLAY findings
├── COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE AUDIT: Full review and consolidation
├── Sprint Planning: Update SPRINT BACKLOG meta-issue (3-5 items max)
├── Architecture Updates: Update DESIGN meta-issue with lessons
└── Completion: GitHub API updates ONLY - NO git operations
```

**SYSTEMATIC PLANNING PROCESS**:
1. **Sprint Transition Assessment**: Current sprint completion verification
2. **Comprehensive Input Analysis**:
   - ALL open GitHub issues from PLAY findings via GitHub API
   - SPRINT BACKLOG meta-issue EPICS and priorities assessment  
   - DESIGN meta-issue architectural context integration
   - User requirements incorporation (if provided)
3. **MANDATORY ISSUE AUDIT AND CONSOLIDATION**:
   - Full review of existing open issues using `gh issue list --state open --limit 500`
   - Relevance assessment and obsolete issue closure/archival
   - Non-actionable issue elimination (workflow reminders, process docs)
   - Systematic duplicate detection and consolidation protocols
   - Priority reassessment based on architectural impact analysis
   - Actionable defect retention only (specific bugs, broken functionality)
   - Implementation guidance enhancement for clarity and precision
4. **Streamlined Sprint Planning**:
   - SPRINT BACKLOG meta-issue cleanup: Remove DONE entries
   - SPRINT_BACKLOG section rewrite with precise issues under EPICs (3-5 max)
   - Defect fixes balanced with new requirements
   - Clear sprint goal and Definition of Done establishment
5. **Architecture Documentation Updates**:
   - DESIGN meta-issue updates with lessons learned documentation
   - Architectural decision documentation for next sprint planning
   - Integration pattern planning and technical approach documentation
   - Documentation task addition to SPRINT BACKLOG meta-issue as notes
6. **GitHub API Completion**: Meta-issue updates via descriptions - **NO GIT OPERATIONS**
