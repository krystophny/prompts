# Quality-driven Agent Development System (QADS)

A quality-driven multi-agent software development system featuring specialized AI agents working collaboratively through structured TDD processes.

## User Control & Flexibility

**Complete control**: This system serves you. All workflows, processes, and decisions can be overridden by your explicit direction.

Override examples:
- "Use simple workflow for this complex change"
- "Skip reviews and just implement"
- "Work on issue #123" (bypasses automatic selection)
- "Let me review everything manually"
- "Just fix this quickly without full workflow"

## Quick Start

Choose your approach:

1. **Structured Workflow**: Let the system guide you through defined processes
2. **Custom Control**: Override any decisions with your specific requirements
3. **Ad Hoc Tasks**: Give any task outside existing workflows

Workflow options:
- **Feature Planning** → Strategic planning with chris-architect
- **Feature Development** → Structured implementation workflow  
- **Playtest Workflow** → Comprehensive system audit
- **Custom Tasks** → Any work you specify

Execution Modes:
- Single Task (default): Complete one task and stop
- Batch Mode: Solve all issues automatically - fully autonomous
- Manual Review: Include your review at any stage
- Custom Flow: Define your own process

## Workflow Types

### Feature Planning
*User ↔ chris-architect collaboration*

```
Goals/Requirements ──▶ chris-architect ──▶ DESIGN.md + GitHub Issues
```

- Strategic planning and requirements capture
- chris-architect has full authority to create/update DESIGN.md and issues
- Use when starting new features or major changes

### Feature Development  
*Multi-agent structured implementation*

- Execute planned work through TDD workflow
- chris-architect restricted to issue selection and prioritization
- 7-phase workflow from tests to delivery

### Playtest Workflow
*Comprehensive system audit - DEFECTS ONLY*

```
Clean Repository ──▶ Automatic Trigger ──▶ System Audit ──▶ DEFECT Backlog
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Playtest NEVER creates issues for new features or scope expansion
- Discover DEFECTS ONLY through exhaustive system exploration
- Automatically initiated when repository is clean (no PRs/issues)
- Serial audit by all agents to build comprehensive DEFECT backlog
- Creates GitHub issues labeled by severity for DEFECTS only - not new features
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Quality assurance of existing functionality - not feature planning

## Workflow Selection

Choose the right workflow based on task complexity:

### Simple Workflow
*Default criteria OR your override:*

✅ Single file affected  
✅ No API/interface changes  
✅ No new dependencies  
✅ Estimated <2 hours work  
✅ **Your choice**: Say "use simple workflow" for any task

Process: sergei-perfectionist-coder → Serial Review Chain → fixes → max cleanup
- Serial Review Chain: max validation (first reviewer) → patrick review → chris-architect final review
- Your control: Override any step or include manual review

### Complex Workflow  
*Default triggers OR your override:*

❌ Multiple files affected  
❌ API/interface changes required  
❌ New dependencies needed  
❌ Estimated >2 hours work  
❌ Architecture impact  
❌ New features requiring documentation  
✅ **Your choice**: Say "use complex workflow" for any task

Process: Full 7-phase workflow (detailed below) - customize any phase

---

## Simple Workflow Process

Phases:
1. **Phase 1**: sergei-perfectionist-coder implements changes
2. **Phase 2**: Serial Review Chain (max validation (FIRST REVIEWER) → patrick review → chris-architect final review)
3. **Phase 3**: max cleanup and completion

Manual Review Mode: User participates as final reviewer (only when explicitly requested)

Findings Protocol: CRITICAL → immediate handback | MAJOR/MINOR → Fix Now (<30min) or File Issue
Critical Handback: sergei fixes → return to first reviewer (max) → restart entire review chain from beginning
Iteration: Repeat phases until all findings resolved

Batch Behavior:
- Single Issue (default): Complete one issue → stop
- Batch Mode: Continue automatically until all issues resolved (can run indefinitely - see Batch Mode section)

## Complex Workflow Process

Key Principle: Never start new work when existing work is unfinished

### 7-Phase Development Process

Phase 1-2: Planning & Prioritization
1. **max**: Repository assessment (non-draft PRs → review phase | draft PRs → implementation | remote branches → test phase | open issues → selection or user-specified)
2. **chris-architect**: Issue selection and prioritization (if no existing work found and no user-specified issue)

Phase 3: Architecture Documentation
3. **chris-architect**: Reviews DESIGN.md, creates implementation plan

Phase 4: RED Phase (Test-Driven Development)
4. **georg-test-engineer**: Writes failing tests and opens draft PR (parallel with chris refinements)

Phase 5: Documentation → Implementation (Serial Execution - docs first)
5. **Implementation Phase** (docs-first approach):
   - **winny-technical-writer**: User documentation 
   - **sergei-perfectionist-coder**: Code + API documentation using winny's docs as guide

Phase 6: Serial Review Chain (fully serial execution):
   - **max**: Technical validation (FIRST REVIEWER) → immediate handback if critical issues
   - **patrick-auditor**: Code quality + security → immediate handback if critical issues
   - **vicky-acceptance-tester**: User acceptance + UX → immediate handback if critical issues
   - **chris-architect**: Architecture alignment → immediate handback if critical issues
   - **User**: Final review (manual review mode only) → immediate handback if critical issues

Phase 7: Completion (combined final phase)
- **max**: Repository cleanup, CI validation, PR merge, working directory cleanup
- **chris-architect**: Executive summary report to user

## Issue Sources & Management

Issues come from three sources:

| Source | When Created | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Feature Planning** | User requirements with chris-architect | Strategic development tasks |
| **Review Findings** | During Phase 6-7 when fixes need >30min | Prevent scope creep |
| **Playtest Audit** | System-wide testing on clean repository | Comprehensive DEFECT backlog (NEVER new features) |

Management Principles:
- Fix Now (<30min) or File Issue: Critical findings fixed immediately, others become issues  
- Labels: [CRITICAL], [BUG], [TECHNICAL-DEBT], [SECURITY], [DOCS] (defects only)
- ⚠️ **FORBIDDEN in playtest**: [IMPROVEMENT], [ENHANCEMENT], [FEATURE], [UX] (unless fixing broken UX)
- Default Management: chris-architect handles lifecycle, triage, prioritization
- Your Control: Override any selection, specify exact issue, or provide custom tasks

---

## Core Principles

### Quality Standards
- **TDD Workflow**: Test-driven development with meaningful coverage
- **MVP Focus**: Highest quality minimum viable product delivery
- **Zero Shortcuts**: 100% completion, no placeholders or stubs
- **Code Quality**: SOLID, KISS, SRP, DRY principles
- **Precision**: Computational physics-level accuracy

### Code Standards
- **Style**: 88 char limit, 4-space indent, self-documenting
- **Commits**: Conventional format, imperative mood, <72 chars
- **Fortran**: `typename_t` convention, empty associate blocks

### Workflow Modes

Execution Modes:

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Single Issue** (default) | Standard operation | Complete one issue → stop |
| **Batch Mode** | User says "solve all issues" | Fully autonomous - Continue until all issues resolved (typically infinite due to playtest) |

Review Modes (Independent):

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Automatic Review** (default) | Standard operation | All agents complete review autonomously |
| **Manual Review** | User says "manual mode" | User participates as final reviewer in workflow |

Valid Combinations:
- Single Task + Automatic Review (DEFAULT)
- Single Task + Manual Review
- Batch Mode + Automatic Review  
- Batch Mode + Manual Review
- Custom Combination: Define your own workflow mix

### Definition of Done
✅ All tests pass with meaningful coverage  
✅ CI green, zero build artifacts  
✅ Documentation updated atomically  
✅ All reviewers approve (critical findings fixed)

### Historical Context

QADS applies proven quality practices at **micro-scale** - every single issue and PR follows the same structured protocol with quality gates, multi-stage reviews, rapid handback cycles, and clear ownership. What typically applies to large projects, QADS executes consistently for every small change.

Core Practices:
- **Quality Gates**: Multi-stage review checkpoints with go/no-go decisions before progression
- **Test-Driven Development**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with separate design and implementation roles
- **Structured Review Process**: Systematic handoffs between specialized roles with defined criteria
- **Rapid Iteration**: Short cycles with immediate feedback and handback on critical findings
- **Clear Ownership**: Each agent has distinct responsibilities and decision authority

Key Insight: Rather than applying heavy process to large features, QADS applies lightweight but rigorous process to every change, ensuring consistent quality through systematic execution by AI agents who never skip steps or cut corners.

## Playtest Workflow Process

When Triggered: Repository is clean (zero PRs, zero issues)

Example Trigger:
```bash
$ gh pr list
# No open pull requests

$ gh issue list  
# No open issues

# → Playtest Workflow automatically initiates
```

Serial Audit Phases:
1. **max-devops-engineer**: Repository health check, build validation, CI verification
2. **patrick-auditor**: Security audit, code quality review, technical debt identification  
3. **vicky-acceptance-tester**: Exhaustive user testing, stress testing, edge case exploration
4. **chris-architect**: Architecture review, design consistency validation, strategic assessment
5. **All agents**: File issues for discovered DEFECTS ONLY at appropriate severity levels
6. **max-devops-engineer**: Ensure all findings documented as GitHub issues

⚠️ **AGENT CONSTRAINT**: Every agent must focus ONLY on defects - broken functionality, bugs, security issues. NEVER file feature requests or scope expansion.

Issue Labels Created (DEFECTS ONLY):
- `[CRITICAL]` - System-breaking issues requiring immediate attention
- `[BUG]` - Broken functionality that needs repair
- `[TECHNICAL-DEBT]` - Code quality and maintainability defects
- `[SECURITY]` - Security vulnerabilities requiring fixes
- `[DOCS]` - Documentation errors or broken examples

⚠️ **FORBIDDEN LABELS in playtest**: `[IMPROVEMENT]`, `[ENHANCEMENT]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[UX]` (unless fixing broken UX)
- 🎯 **Playtest Rule**: File issues only for what's broken, never for what's missing

Completion Modes:
- Single Mode (default): After playtest → chris-architect Executive Summary → STOP
- Batch Mode: After playtest → immediately continue resolving all discovered issues → triggers new playtest when clean → potentially infinite cycle

---

## Batch Mode Behavior

Critical Warning: Batch mode typically runs indefinitely because the playtest workflow discovers new defect issues each time the repository becomes clean. Only use batch mode when you have significant time available.

⚠️ **Note**: Playtest discovers DEFECTS only - not new features. Feature requests must come from Feature Planning phase.

Activation: User explicitly requests "solve all open issues" or "fix all issues"

Example Usage:
```bash
# User says: "solve all open issues"
# → Triggers batch mode for ALL workflows
```

Batch Mode Logic:

Warning: Batch mode can run indefinitely because playtest workflow usually discovers new issues

1. **Workflow Continuation**: After completing ANY issue → return to PHASE 1 (max-devops assessment)
2. **Automatic Playtest Trigger**: When repository is clean (zero issues), playtest workflow automatically runs
3. **Issue Replenishment**: Playtest typically discovers new issues and files them as GitHub issues
4. **Infinite Cycle Potential**: New issues → batch continues → clean repository → playtest → more issues → repeat
5. **Rare Termination**: Batch only stops when playtest discovers ZERO issues (very rare)
6. **Final Summary Only**: Executive Summary delivered only after playtest finds zero issues

Works With All Workflows:
- **Simple Workflow Batch**: Complete simple issue → assess repository → continue if issues remain
- **Complex Workflow Batch**: Complete complex issue → assess repository → continue if issues remain  
- **Playtest + Batch**: Clean repository triggers playtest → creates issues → immediately resolves ALL issues → clean repository → playtest again → potentially infinite

Batch Mode Flow:
```
WARNING: Can run indefinitely due to playtest replenishment

Start → Complete Issue → Repository Assessment → Issues Remain?
