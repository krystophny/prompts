* The goal of this project is *goal*. Initialize CLAUDE.md with this information.
* *Insert requirements and goals here*. Devise an architectural plan in DESIGN.md and derive a detailed backlog for execution in RED/GREEN/REFACTOR test-driven development with non-shallow and non-tautological tests in a set of well and detailed issues on GitHub. Emphasize that no cheating and no shortcuts, simplifications, stubs or placeholders are allowed. Then commit and push.
* Take the next issue on GitHub and get it done in a new branch. No cheating, no shortcuts, no simplifications, no stubs, no placeholders. Write targetted tests that initially fail (RED phase), implement full functionality to make them pass (GREEN phase), clean up implementation (REFACTOR phase), see that all tests still pass. Do this in small steps. After each step, update issue description, commit, push. Once finished, open a PR.
* Check the whole codebase and all tests if you cheated or took a shortcut or wrote a stub just to get something to look like it works superficially. Then fix all honestly in small steps covered by tests.
* Consider the current failing tests and problems, devise a solution strategy, and add a list of issues with a detailed checklist what to do to resolve it.
