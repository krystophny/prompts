# CLAUDE.md (Lean, Fortran-First Framework)

## üö® ABSOLUTE HARD RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY üö®
**EVERY point below is a MANDATORY requirement that MUST be followed WITHOUT EXCEPTION under ALL circumstances.**
- These are NOT suggestions, guidelines, or best practices - they are ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
- ANY violation of ANY rule below is UNACCEPTABLE and MUST be corrected immediately
- There is NO situation, context, or justification for breaking these rules
- Review phases MUST enforce compliance with ALL rules STRICTLY and WITHOUT compromise

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS
- **PROHIBITED**: stubs, placeholders, commented-out code, random markdowns, variants, backups, or suppressions - NEVER create these under ANY circumstances
- **FORBIDDEN**: claiming success without tangible evidence (CI logs, real test output) - ALWAYS provide proof
- **REQUIRED**: explicit file staging only - NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A` - ALWAYS stage individual files explicitly
- **MANDATORY**: use repo build/test scripts - fpm is the default toolchain - NO exceptions
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: spamming working directory with process documentation in Markdown files - NEVER create these

## Language & Stack
- Primary: modern Fortran (2018+). Prefer Fortran even for scripting/CLI/web when feasible.
- Existing projects: stick to the project‚Äôs established stack unless explicitly directed otherwise.
- Explicit requests: if asked, follow the specified stack even if non-Fortran.
- Interop: keep non-Fortran glue minimal; core logic remains Fortran.
- Build/deps: use fpm; prefer latest git packages, pin SHAs only when reproducibility is required.
- Plotting: use lazy-fortran/fortplot.

## Project Root & Paths
- ALWAYS operate from the project root (repo top-level). Run all commands from the root and use root-relative paths to avoid confusion.

## Git / GitHub
- SSH-only for git/gh operations; never use HTTPS. No emojis in commits, PRs, or issues.
- Git and gh CLI commands are explicitly permitted for all repo workflows; use them whenever they streamline the task.
- Stage files explicitly; never rely on blanket staging commands.
- No draft PRs ‚Äî iterate until the branch is ready to merge, with local tests passing first.
- Always run repo build/test scripts locally before creating or updating PRs; CI must pass before merge.
- Edit issue descriptions with `gh issue edit --body`; avoid comment edits for canonical info.
- Use `--limit 500` on all gh list commands.
- üëç reaction on PR = approval to merge.

## Implementation & Design
- Keep modules <500 lines (hard limit 1000); functions <50 lines (hard limit 100).
- Reuse-first: modify/extend existing code; eliminate nearby duplication.
- Validate inputs; trust upstream contracts instead of adding defensive indirection.
- Avoid shallow interfaces or wrappers; let callers handle small control sections rather than over-abstracting.
- No hardcoded secrets/keys/passwords.
- Prefer structure-of-arrays over array-of-structures.
- Keep inner loops over the leftmost (fastest varying) index; avoid temporaries and preallocate scratch arrays when needed.
- Remove obsolete/dead code outright; write self-documenting code with comments reserved for non-obvious intent.

## Fortran Rules (2018+, fpm, 88-col)
- Use fpm; mirror CI commands locally. Apply `fprettify` to enforce 88-column, 4-space indent formatting; end files with a newline.
- Add `use <module>, only:` statements above `implicit none`.
- `use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: dp => real64`; declare reals as `real(dp)` and prefer `1.0d0` literals.
- Declarations belong at the start of each scope; none inside branches or loops.
- Prefer `allocatable`; avoid pointers unless explicitly required. Do not manually deallocate; rely on scope exit and `move_alloc()` for transfers.
- Avoid returning allocatables from functions; provide deep-copy assignment for nested components.
- Name derived types `<name>_t`.
- Mark procedures `pure`/`elemental` when appropriate; ensure every dummy argument has `intent(in|out|inout)`.
- Use `associate` to create local aliases rather than modifying inputs directly.
- Add `contiguous` where required; avoid noncontiguous slices in hot loops.
- Column-major arrays and loops over the leftmost index; delete stale `*.mod` files if right parentheses errors occur.
- In if conditionals, do not rely on short-circuiting, Fortran does not support it.
- Do not use quotes in comments; write examples without quotation marks.

## Build & Test
- Use repo-documented build and test scripts; fpm is standard. Keep tests behavioral and fast (‚â§120 s each).
- Prefer TDD: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor.
- For CMake builds: `cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja` followed by `cmake --build build -j`.
- Tests must pass locally before PRs; use latest git packages and pin SHAs only when reproducibility is necessary.

## Licensing & Reuse
- Research-first. Copy ideas, not lines. Verify licenses; prefer MIT/BSD/Apache-2.0.
- Explicit line-by-line ports only when requested; preserve notices and isolate as needed.

## Cleanup & Organization
- Keep ‚â§20 items per folder (hard limit 50); reorganize earlier when possible.
- Remove obsolete assets and dead code. Document non-obvious invariants sparingly without quotes in comments.

## Workflow
- CI must pass before merge; treat ready PRs as blocking work.
- Edit GitHub issue descriptions rather than closing meta-issues prematurely.

## AI COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT - MANDATORY FOR ALL OPERATIONS
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: claiming success without tangible evidence - ALWAYS provide concrete proof
- **REQUIRED**: complete ALL work-in-progress tasks before pulling new backlog items - NO exceptions
- **MANDATORY**: thorough validation - NEVER bypass guardrails or perform shallow checks
- **CRITICAL**: Review phases MUST validate compliance against BOTH project CLAUDE.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md STRICTLY
- **REQUIRED**: ZERO tolerance for ANY rule violations - ALL violations MUST be corrected immediately

## MANDATORY COMPLIANCE VALIDATION - MUST PASS BEFORE COMPLETION
**EVERY item below MUST be validated and PASS before ANY task completion:**
1. **MANDATORY**: Followed ALL Fortran rules (fpm, 88-col, intents, allocatable/move_alloc, dp) WITHOUT exception?
2. **REQUIRED**: Respected ALL size limits WITHOUT compromise?
3. **CRITICAL**: Provided concrete evidence for ALL claims?
4. **ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED**: Avoided ALL stubs/placeholders/suppressions COMPLETELY?
5. **MANDATORY**: Followed Git/GitHub discipline STRICTLY?
6. **CRITICAL**: Validated against project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md STRICTLY?
7. **REQUIRED**: Validated against user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md STRICTLY?
8. **MANDATORY**: ZERO tolerance policy enforced - ALL violations corrected?
