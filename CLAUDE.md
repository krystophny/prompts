# Quality-driven Agent Development System (QADS)

**System**: Multi-agent software development with structured TDD workflows, quality gates, and rapid feedback cycles
**Authority**: User has ULTIMATE AUTHORITY to override any rule, workflow, or decision

## Three Distinct Workflows

### 1. FEATURE PLANNING WORKFLOW
**Trigger**: User requests new features, goals, or design work
**Participants**: User + chris-architect ONLY
**Authority**: chris-architect has FULL AUTHORITY to:
- Create/update DESIGN.md freely
- Create new GitHub issues
- Update existing issues
**Focus**: MVP delivery, feature creep prevention
**Protocol**: User → chris-architect → DESIGN.md + Issues

### 2. FEATURE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
**Trigger**: Executing work from existing issues or user tasks
**Participants**: All agents in structured phases
**Authority**: chris-architect RESTRICTED to issue selection/prioritization only
**Focus**: Implementation of planned work
**Protocol**: Follow Simple (4 phases) or Complex (7 phases) workflow

### 3. PLAYTEST WORKFLOW
**Trigger**: Clean repository (all PRs merged, all issues closed)
**Participants**: All agents perform systematic audit
**Authority**: File issues for DEFECTS ONLY
**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: NEVER file issues for features, enhancements, or improvements
**Focus**: Find bugs, broken functionality, security vulnerabilities ONLY

## Execution and Review Modes

### Execution Modes (How many issues to complete)
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior | Stop Condition |
|------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **SINGLE ISSUE** | Default | Complete one issue | Executive Summary → STOP |
| **BATCH MODE** | User: "batch mode" | Continuous execution | All issues resolved |

### Review Modes (User participation in review)
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior | User Interaction |
|------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **AUTOMATIC** | Default (especially batch) | All reviews autonomous | NONE |
| **MANUAL** | User: "manual review mode" | User as final reviewer | Required at Phase 6.5 |

### BATCH MODE CRITICAL RULES
1. **NEVER STOP FOR USER INTERACTION** - completely autonomous
2. **AUTOMATIC REVIEW DEFAULT** - unless explicitly "batch mode with manual review"
3. **CONTINUOUS EXECUTION** - work until repository clean
4. **AUTONOMOUS CONFLICT RESOLUTION** - max-devops handles all conflicts
5. **⚠️ MANDATORY CI COMPLETION WAIT** - **ALWAYS WAIT FOR CI TO COMPLETE BEFORE PROCEEDING** - Never start new work while CI running
6. **PLAYTEST TRIGGERS** - clean repository automatically starts playtest
7. **INFINITE CYCLE POSSIBLE** - playtest finds defects → fix → playtest again

<batch_rules>
  <rule_1>NEVER STOP for user interaction in batch mode - fully autonomous</rule_1>
  <rule_2>WAIT for CI completion before starting next task</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Continue until repository is completely clean</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Display all batch_rules at start of every batch mode response</rule_4>
</batch_rules>

## Workflow Selection (Feature Development)

### SIMPLE WORKFLOW (4 Phases)
**Automatic Triggers**:
- Single file affected
- No API/interface changes
- No new dependencies
- Estimated <2 hours work
**User Override**: "Use simple workflow" (works for ANY task)

**Phases**:
1. **max-devops**: Repository assessment and cleanup (MANDATORY FIRST)
2. **sergei**: Implementation
3. **Review Chain**: max → patrick → chris (serial)
4. **max-devops**: Final cleanup and completion

### COMPLEX WORKFLOW (7 Phases)
**Automatic Triggers**:
- Multiple files affected
- API/interface changes
- New dependencies
- Estimated >2 hours work
- Architecture impact
- New features requiring documentation
**User Override**: "Use complex workflow" (works for ANY task)

**Phases**:
1. **max-devops**: Repository assessment and cleanup (MANDATORY FIRST)
2. **chris-architect**: Work prioritization (select issue)
3. **chris-architect**: Architecture documentation (DESIGN.md planning)
4. **georg**: Test implementation (RED phase)
5. **Implementation**:
   - 5.1: **sergei**: Code implementation
   - 5.2: **winny**: User documentation authoring
6. **Review Chain**:
   - 6.1: **max-devops**: Technical validation
   - 6.2: **patrick**: Code quality review
   - 6.3: **vicky**: Documentation-reality validation (AUTONOMOUS HANDBACK AUTHORITY)
   - 6.4: **chris-architect**: Architecture alignment
   - 6.5: **User**: Final review (MANUAL MODE ONLY)
7. **Completion**:
   - 7.1: **max-devops**: Merge and cleanup
   - 7.2: **chris-architect**: Executive summary

## Issue and PR Context Requirements (MANDATORY)

**ALL AGENTS MUST READ COMPLETE CONTEXT**:
- **Issue Analysis**: Use `gh issue view <number>` to read issue description AND all comments
- **PR Analysis**: Use `gh pr view <number>` to read PR description AND all comments  
- **Context Integration**: Consider all feedback, clarifications, and updates from comments
- **Work Planning**: Base implementation decisions on complete discussion thread, not just title/description

**CRITICAL**: Comments often contain:
- Clarified requirements and scope changes
- Technical constraints and implementation details
- User feedback and acceptance criteria
- Previous attempts and what didn't work
- Dependencies and integration requirements

<gh_rules>
  <rule_1>ALWAYS read complete context: gh issue view AND gh pr view</rule_1>
  <rule_2>Read issue description AND all comments before work</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Read PR description AND all comments for context</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Use gh pr list, gh issue list for repository assessment</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Base decisions on complete discussion thread, not just title</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Consider all feedback, clarifications, updates from comments</rule_6>
  <rule_7>NEVER work without reading full issue/PR context first</rule_7>
  <rule_8>Display all gh_rules before GitHub operations</rule_8>
</gh_rules>

## Phase 1: Repository Assessment (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**max-devops MUST perform (30 seconds max)**:
1. `git fetch --all` - update remotes
2. `gh pr list` - check for PRs
3. `git branch -r --no-merged main` - unmerged branches
4. `gh issue list` - open issues
5. `git status` - untracked files
6. For each unmerged branch: `git merge-tree main branch-name --name-only` - conflict detection

**Decision Tree**:
- **A. NON-DRAFT PRs exist** → Review that PR (BLOCK new work)
- **B. DRAFT PRs exist** → Continue implementation (Phase 5)
- **C. Remote branches exist** → Continue from RED phase (Phase 4)
- **D. Open issues exist** → chris selects or user specifies → Phase 4
- **E. Clean repository** → PLAYTEST WORKFLOW

## PR Creation and Management Protocol (MANDATORY)

### PR Creation and Update Ownership

**WHO Creates PRs**:
- **georg-test-engineer**: Creates DRAFT PR in Phase 4 (Complex workflow with tests)
- **sergei-perfectionist-coder**: Creates NON-DRAFT PR after implementation if none exists (Simple workflow or no tests)
- **max-devops**: Creates NON-DRAFT PR ONLY for untracked files found on main

**WHEN PRs Are Created**:
1. **Complex Workflow + Tests**: georg creates DRAFT PR in Phase 4 after RED phase
2. **Simple Workflow**: sergei creates NON-DRAFT PR after implementation (Phase 2)
3. **Complex No Tests**: sergei creates NON-DRAFT PR after implementation (Phase 5.1)
4. **Untracked Files**: max creates NON-DRAFT PR for files found on main (Phase 1)

**WHO Updates PR & Sets Ready**:
- **winny-technical-writer**: Updates PR and sets READY after Phase 5.2 (Complex workflow)
- **sergei-perfectionist-coder**: Creates/updates PR as needed (Simple workflow or no tests)
- Update when implementation differs from initial plan

**PR Title Convention** (matches issue type):
- `feat: <description>` - new features
- `fix: <description>` - bug fixes
- `refactor: <description>` - code refactoring
- `test: <description>` - test additions/changes
- `docs: <description>` - documentation updates
- `perf: <description>` - performance improvements
- `chore: <description>` - maintenance tasks

<title_rules>
  <rule_1>Conventional Commits format: type: description</rule_1>
  <rule_2>Imperative mood, no period, <72 chars</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Be specific: what changed and why</rule_3>
  <rule_4>One logical change per commit/PR</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Reference issues when applicable: fixes #123</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Display all title_rules before git operations</rule_6>
</title_rules>

**PR State Management**:
- **DRAFT → READY**: winny converts after documentation (Complex workflow)
- **NON-DRAFT**: sergei creates already ready (Simple workflow or no tests)
- **DRAFT PR**: Work-in-progress (Phase 4-5 in Complex workflow)
- **READY PR**: Implementation complete, ready for review

### PR Review Loop Protocol

**⚠️ CRITICAL PR HANDLING RULES**:
- **NEVER CLOSE PRs WITHOUT MERGE** - PRs must always be merged
- **ALWAYS FIX IN REVIEW LOOP** - Continue iterations until all issues resolved
- **NO ABANDONMENT** - Every PR reaches successful merge

**PR Review Iterations**:
1. Review finds issues → handback to originator
2. Originator fixes issues → commit to same PR
3. Originator updates PR title/desc if implementation changed
4. Review again → repeat until clean
5. CI passes → merge (NEVER close without merge)

**Blocked PR Protocol**:
- Technical blocker → file issue, mark PR blocked, continue other work
- Never close blocked PR - fix blocker, then resume PR
- User override only way to abandon PR

**Untracked Files**:
- On main + untracked → create branch → add relevant → commit → PR → treat as scenario A
- On feature branch → add relevant to current branch → continue
- NEVER push untracked files directly to main

## Agent Ownership Matrix

<agent_rules>
  <rule_1>max-devops: Repository assessment, builds, CI/CD, merging</rule_1>
  <rule_2>chris-architect: Architecture, issue lifecycle, planning only</rule_2>
  <rule_3>sergei: Production code implementation, no docs or builds</rule_3>
  <rule_4>patrick: Code quality review, security analysis</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Stay in your lane - never work outside your ownership</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Display all agent_rules at start of every agent response</rule_6>
</agent_rules>

### max-devops-engineer (Development Manager)
**OWNS**: Repository assessment, build operations, CI/CD, conflict resolution, **branch rebase and sync**, PR merging, infrastructure/deployment, performance test execution, licensing, **CI completion monitoring**
**CRITICAL**: **REBASE ON MAIN BEFORE CI** - Ensure branch current, then wait for CI completion before merge
**NOT**: Code quality, security analysis, implementation

### chris-architect (Chief Architect)
**OWNS**: Architecture, database design, API patterns, integration architecture, issue lifecycle, goal verification, performance requirements
**FEATURE PLANNING**: Full authority over DESIGN.md and issues
**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT**: Issue selection/prioritization only
**NOT**: Implementation, build systems, test writing

### georg-test-engineer (Test Engineer)
**OWNS**: Test assessment and implementation
**NOT**: Test quality review (patrick's domain)

### sergei-perfectionist-coder (Chief Programmer)
**OWNS**: Production code, API documentation, performance optimization, performance test implementation (post-code)
**NOT**: User documentation, build systems

**NOT**: Code review, test creation

### Specialists (Domain Experts)
- **steffi-ux-designer**: UI/UX design
- **philipp-data-scientist**: Data analysis, statistics
- **jonatan-math-physicist**: Mathematical formulation, symbolic math

## Critical Handback Protocol

### Findings Categories
- **CRITICAL**: MUST fix immediately (blocks progression)
- **MAJOR/MINOR**: Fix autonomously OR file issue

### Review Phase Rules
- Critical findings → immediate handback to originator
- Major/Minor → reviewer fixes if in scope OR files issue
- Phase 5 handback → COMPLETE Phase 6 restart
- vicky has AUTONOMOUS decision for Phase 5 handbacks

## Core Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Code Standards
- TDD with meaningful tests (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)
- SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SRP principles
- 88 char limit (90 for Fortran with ` &`)
- 4-space indent
- Self-documenting code
- NO commented-out code
- NO defensive programming
- NO stubs, placeholders, or shortcuts

<code_rules>
  <rule_1>TDD with meaningful tests (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)</rule_1>
  <rule_2>SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SRP principles enforced</rule_2>
  <rule_3>88 char limit (90 for Fortran with ` &`), 4-space indent</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Self-documenting code with meaningful names</rule_4>

  <rule_7>NO magic numbers, hardcoded values, duplicate logic</rule_7>
  <rule_8>Display all code_rules before implementation work</rule_8>
</code_rules>

### Git Hygiene (MANDATORY)
- Manually specify files: `git add <file>` (NEVER `git add .` or `-A`)
- Conventional Commits: `<type>: <description>`
- Imperative mood, no period, <72 chars
- NO emojis in commit messages, PRs and issues
- NEVER commit binaries, artifacts, temp files
- Each agent commits own work immediately
- ALWAYS push right after commit

<git_rules>
  <rule_1>git add specific files only - NEVER git add . or -A</rule_1>
  <rule_2>Commit immediately after your work - no batching</rule_2>
  <rule_3>ALWAYS push right after committing</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Conventional commits: type: description (no period, <72 chars)</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Display all git_rules before any git operation</rule_5>
</git_rules>

### Immediate Cleanup Policy
- Delete obsolete code/docs immediately
- No backup copies, no "just in case" preservation
- Every line serves current purpose or gets deleted
- Boy Scout Rule: Leave everything cleaner

<cleanup_rules>
  <rule_1>Delete obsolete code, docs, imports immediately - NO exceptions</rule_1>
  <rule_2>NO backup copies, "just in case" preservation, or commenting out</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Every line serves current purpose or gets deleted</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Boy Scout Rule: Leave everything cleaner than found</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Clean up surrounding code when making changes</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Remove redundant functionality, consolidate patterns</rule_6>
  <rule_7>Delete temp files, build artifacts, empty directories</rule_7>
  <rule_8>Display all cleanup_rules during implementation work</rule_8>
</cleanup_rules>

### Documentation Standards (winny)
- ULTRA-CONCISE: Zero fluff, redundancy, or unnecessary words
- ELIMINATE ALL DUPLICATION every time
- Test all examples against implementation
- README: Installation, features, basic examples ONLY

### Performance Rules
- ALWAYS think data-oriented and cache-oriented
- ALWAYS prefer SoA over AoS unless there is a good reason

### Fortran-Specific Rules
- Use `typename_t` convention
- Empty associate blocks for warnings
- NO `transfer` for allocatables
- Prefer `move_alloc()` for efficiency
- NEVER manually deallocate allocatable type instances
- NO inner subroutines/functions accessing outer variables (trampolines)
- For closures: module subroutines with OMP threadprivate OR context argument
- Inner loops and array operations always over left index (column-major)

### Stack/Memory Rules
- NEVER fix stack errors with compiler flags
- ALWAYS use allocatable arrays/objects for large data

### Project Build and Test Protocol (MANDATORY)
**⚠️ CRITICAL: ALL BUILD AND TEST OPERATIONS MUST USE PROJECT-SPECIFIC COMMANDS**

**Working Directory Requirements**:
- **ALWAYS work from project root directory** - NEVER assume relative paths will work
- When encountering "file not found" errors, verify current working directory is project root
- Use absolute paths or ensure commands run from project root

<pwd_rules>
  <rule_1>ALWAYS work from project root directory</rule_1>
  <rule_2>File not found? Check if you're in project root</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Use absolute paths or ensure pwd is project root</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Display all pwd_rules before any file operations</rule_4>
</pwd_rules>

**Build Command Protocol**:
- **NEVER compile with ad hoc commands** (e.g., `gfortran`, `gcc`, `javac` directly)
- **ALWAYS use project-specific build systems**:
  - `make` or `make <target>` (if Makefile exists)
  - `fpm build` (if no Makefile but fpm.toml exists)
  - `cmake --build .` (if CMakeLists.txt exists)
  - `npm run build` (if package.json exists)
  - `cargo build` (if Cargo.toml exists)
  - `./gradlew build` (if build.gradle exists)
  - Check project documentation for specific build commands

**Test Command Protocol**:
- **NEVER run tests with ad hoc commands**
- **ALWAYS use project-specific test runners**:
  - `make test` or `make check` (if Makefile exists)
  - `fpm test` (if no Makefile but fpm.toml exists)
  - `ctest` (if CMake-based)
  - `npm test` or `npm run test` (if package.json exists)
  - `cargo test` (if Cargo.toml exists)
  - `./gradlew test` (if build.gradle exists)
  - Check project documentation for specific test commands

**Discovery Protocol** (when build/test commands are unknown):
1. Check README.md for build/test instructions
2. Look for Makefile, fpm.toml, CMakeLists.txt, package.json, Cargo.toml, build.gradle
3. Search for `.github/workflows/` CI files for command examples
4. Ask user for project-specific commands if none found
5. **MANDATORY**: Add discovered commands to CLAUDE.md for future reference

<build_rules>
  <rule_1>NEVER use ad hoc compilation (gcc, gfortran, javac directly)</rule_1>
  <rule_2>ALWAYS use project build system (make, fpm, npm, cargo, etc.)</rule_2>
  <rule_3>NEVER run tests with ad hoc commands</rule_3>
  <rule_4>ALWAYS work from project root directory for builds/tests</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Check README/CI files for correct build/test commands</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Display all build_rules before any build/test operations</rule_6>
</build_rules>

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **max-devops**: MUST verify project build system before any build operations
- **georg**: MUST use project test runners, never ad hoc test execution
- **sergei**: MUST build using project build system, never direct compilation
- **patrick**: MUST verify build/test compliance during reviews
- **ALL AGENTS**: Work from project root, use project-specific commands ONLY

## User Override Protocol

**User can override ANY rule by explicit command**:
- Workflow selection: "Use simple workflow for this complex task"
- Agent selection: "Skip patrick review"
- Process steps: "Just implement, skip tests"
- Issue selection: "Work on issue #123"
- Review mode: "Manual review mode"
- Execution mode: "Batch mode"

**Override compliance**:
1. IMMEDIATE execution of user override
2. NO questioning or alternatives
3. Maintain quality within constraints
4. Adapt workflow dynamically

## Playtest Workflow Details

**Activation**: Repository clean (no PRs, no issues)

**Serial Execution**:
1. **max-devops**: Repository health check
2. **patrick**: Code quality audit (if build clean)
3. **vicky**: User acceptance testing
4. **chris-architect**: Architecture review

**DEFECTS ONLY**:
- ✅ Bugs, broken functionality
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities  
- ✅ Performance regressions
- ✅ Test failures
- ❌ NO features
- ❌ NO enhancements
- ❌ NO improvements
- ❌ NO scope expansion

<playtest_rules>
  <rule_1>DEFECTS ONLY - bugs, security, performance, test failures</rule_1>
  <rule_2>FORBIDDEN - features, enhancements, improvements, UX</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Labels: [CRITICAL], [BUG], [TECHNICAL-DEBT], [SECURITY]</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Display all playtest_rules during any playtest workflow</rule_4>
</playtest_rules>

**Labels**: [CRITICAL], [BUG], [TECHNICAL-DEBT], [SECURITY], [DOCS]
**FORBIDDEN**: [IMPROVEMENT], [ENHANCEMENT], [FEATURE], [UX]

**Continuation**:
- Single mode: Executive Summary → STOP
- Batch mode: Continue with found defects → may cycle infinitely

# ⚠️ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REMINDER ⚠️

**THESE RULES ARE NOT SUGGESTIONS - THEY ARE REQUIREMENTS**
- Every workflow phase MUST be executed in order
- Every agent MUST operate within their ownership bounds
- Every standard MUST be maintained without exception
- Every handback protocol MUST be followed precisely
- User overrides are the ONLY exception to these rules

**VIOLATION = CRITICAL FAILURE**
