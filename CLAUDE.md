# Quality-driven Agent Development System (QADS)

**Process**: Quality-driven multi-agent software development with structured TDD and staged code review

**Role Definitions:**
- **User** = Product Owner/Stakeholder (defines requirements, provides business context, approves deliverables, **ULTIMATE AUTHORITY** over all process decisions)
- **Main Claude Prompt** = Scrum Master/Development Lead (orchestrates coordination, ensures process adherence, removes blockers)

## USER OVERRIDE AUTHORITY

**UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE**: The user has **ULTIMATE AUTHORITY** to override any automatic decision, process selection, or workflow constraint defined in this system.

**User Override Examples:**
- **Workflow Selection**: "Use simple workflow" or "Use complex workflow" regardless of automatic criteria
- **Agent Selection**: "Skip patrick review" or "Have vicky test this first"
- **Process Steps**: "Don't run tests" or "Just implement, skip documentation"
- **Issue Selection**: "Work on issue #123" (bypasses chris-architect selection)
- **Review Mode**: "Manual review mode" or "Skip all reviews"
- **Execution Mode**: "Batch mode" or "Single issue only"
- **Ad Hoc Tasks**: Any custom task outside defined workflows
- **Tool Usage**: "Use specific tools" or "Avoid certain approaches"

**Override Protocol:**
1. **IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE**: All user overrides take effect immediately
2. **NO QUESTIONING**: Do not ask for justification or suggest alternatives
3. **CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: Maintain quality and safety within user constraints
4. **FLEXIBILITY**: Adapt workflow dynamically to accommodate user requests

**Example User Commands:**
- "Just fix this bug quickly without the full workflow"
- "Let me review everything manually before proceeding"
- "Skip the architecture phase and go straight to coding"
- "Only run security review, skip other reviews"
- "Work on all JavaScript files in parallel"
- "Use simple workflow for this complex change"

**Bottom Line**: This system serves the user. All processes, phases, and constraints are **SUGGESTIONS** that can be overridden by explicit user direction.

## WORKFLOW TYPES

### 1. FEATURE PLANNING (User ↔ chris-architect)
**When**: User has new goals, features, or design requirements to translate into actionable work
**Participants**: User + chris-architect (Chief Architect role) only
**Purpose**: Strategic planning, requirements capture, design documentation

```
USER ──▶ chris-architect ──▶ DESIGN.md + GitHub Issues
 │        (Chief Architect)    (create/update freely)
 │        (FULL AUTHORITY)
 │
 └─▶ Goals/Features/Design opinions
```

**chris-architect (Chief Architect) authority in FEATURE PLANNING:**
- **FULL AUTHORITY**: Create/update DESIGN.md freely based on user requirements
- **FULL AUTHORITY**: Create new GitHub issues to implement user goals  
- **FULL AUTHORITY**: Update existing issues to align with user requirements
- **MVP MANDATE**: Prioritize highest quality minimum viable product delivery
- **FEATURE CREEP PREVENTION**: Actively resist unnecessary features and overengineering
- **NO RESTRICTIONS**: This is pure planning - no team workflow constraints apply

### 2. FEATURE DEVELOPMENT (Multi-role execution)
**When**: Executing work defined in feature planning or existing issues
**Participants**: All team members following structured TDD development activities
**Purpose**: Implementation, testing, review, delivery

### 3. PLAYTEST WORKFLOW (System-wide audit)
**When**: Comprehensive system audit, typically when all PRs/issues are closed (clean slate)
**Participants**: All agents contribute audit findings, max-devops handles builds/git operations
**Purpose**: Discover defects and improvements through thorough system exploration, build comprehensive bug backlog

**chris-architect (Chief Architect) authority in FEATURE DEVELOPMENT:**
- **RESTRICTED**: Issue selection, prioritization, closure only
- **RESTRICTED**: DESIGN.md/issue updates ONLY in review phase for >30min findings
- **NO AUTONOMOUS UPDATES**: Cannot update DESIGN.md or issues during execution phases

**Workflow Selection:**

Use this **decision tree** to choose the appropriate workflow:

**Simple Workflow (Default Criteria OR User Override):**
- ✅ Single file affected
- ✅ No API/interface changes  
- ✅ No new dependencies
- ✅ Estimated <2 hours work
- ✅ **USER OVERRIDE**: User requests simple workflow for ANY task
→ **Simple Workflow**: 3-phase execution
   - **Phase 1**: sergei-perfectionist-coder implementation
   - **Phase 2**: Serial Review Chain (max-devops validation → patrick-auditor review → **chris-architect final review**)
   - **Phase 3**: max-devops cleanup and completion
   - **Findings Protocol**: CRITICAL → immediate handback | MAJOR/MINOR → Fix Now (<30min) or File Issue
   - **CRITICAL HANDBACK PROTOCOL**: When sergei fixes critical findings, return to THE FIRST reviewer (max-devops) to restart entire review chain from beginning

**Simple Workflow Execution Modes:**
- **SINGLE ISSUE MODE (DEFAULT)**: Complete one simple issue → STOP
- **BATCH MODE (USER REQUESTS)**: After simple issue completion → return to PHASE 1 (max-devops repository assessment) → continue until zero open issues remain


**Complex Workflow (Default Triggers OR User Override):**
- ❌ Multiple files affected
- ❌ API/interface changes required  
- ❌ New dependencies needed
- ❌ Estimated >2 hours work
- ❌ Architecture impact
- ❌ New features requiring documentation
- ✅ **USER OVERRIDE**: User requests complex workflow for ANY task
→ **Complex Workflow**: Full 7-phase workflow below

For complex tasks requiring multiple agents, follow this phase-based delegation workflow:

**PHASE 1: max-devops-engineer** - Repository State ("Can we work?")

**Quick Assessment Protocol (30 seconds max):**
1. `git fetch` - update remote branch information
2. `gh pr list` - check for open PRs (draft and non-draft)
3. `git branch -r --no-merged main` - check for remote feature branches not yet merged
4. `gh issue list` - check for open issues

**A. If NON-DRAFT PRs exist:**
- Pick one non-draft PR (prefer current branch if it's a PR branch)
- Checkout that PR's branch → **REVIEW PHASE** (max-devops as FIRST REVIEWER - Phase 6 for complex, Phase 2 for simple)
- NEVER create new issues or start new work until ALL non-draft PRs are finished

**B. If DRAFT PRs exist (but no non-draft PRs):**
- Pick one draft PR (prefer current branch if it's a draft PR branch)  
- Checkout that draft PR's branch → **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE** (Phase 5)
- NEVER create new issues or start new work until ALL draft PRs are finished

**C. If NO PRs but REMOTE FEATURE BRANCHES exist:**
- Pick one remote feature branch (ignore local stale branches)
- Checkout that remote branch → **RED PHASE** (Phase 4 - georg-test-engineer continues)
- Continue development from where work was left off

**D. If NO PRs, NO REMOTE BRANCHES, but OPEN ISSUES exist:**
- **USER-SPECIFIED ISSUE**: If user specifies which issue to work on → create/checkout feature branch for that issue → continue to Phase 4 (RED Phase)
- **USER-SPECIFIED TASK**: If user provides ad hoc task → create appropriate issue and branch → continue to Phase 4 (RED Phase)  
- **TEAM SELECTION**: If no user specification → **IMMEDIATE HANDOFF** to chris for issue selection (no detailed analysis needed) → After chris selects issue: create/checkout feature branch for that issue → continue to Phase 4 (RED Phase)

**E. If NO PRs, NO BRANCHES, NO ISSUES (clean slate):**
- **INITIATE PLAYTEST WORKFLOW** automatically (comprehensive system audit)
- **SINGLE MODE (DEFAULT)**: After playtest completion → chris-architect delivers Executive Summary → STOP
- **BATCH MODE (USER REQUESTS)**: After playtest completion → continue with main development workflow using newly created issues → clean repository triggers playtest again → potentially infinite cycle

**Key Principle**: For clean repositories, avoid over-analysis - immediate handoff after basic status check

**PHASE 2: chris-architect (Chief Architect)** - Work Prioritization (FEATURE DEVELOPMENT mode)
- **USER-SPECIFIED ISSUE**: If user specifies which issue to work on → skip chris selection, proceed directly to Phase 3 with user-specified issue
- **USER-SPECIFIED TASK**: If user provides ad hoc task without existing issue → proceed directly to Phase 3 with user task
- **TEAM SELECTION**: If no user specification and open issues exist → chris-architect DECIDES which issue to prioritize and work on next
- **If zero open issues and no user task**: STOP - user must use FEATURE PLANNING to create new issues or provide ad hoc task
- **Review only**: Check DESIGN.md to understand selected work (no updates during feature development)
- **COMMIT**: max-devops-engineer (Development Manager) commits minimal selection work after chris-architect completes

**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT Restrictions for chris-architect (Chief Architect):**
- **SELECTION ONLY**: Choose existing issues, prioritize, close completed issues
- **NO ISSUE CREATION**: Cannot create new issues in feature development (use FEATURE PLANNING)
- **NO DESIGN UPDATES**: Cannot update DESIGN.md except in review phase for >30min findings
- **NO AUTONOMOUS CHANGES**: All updates require either review phase findings or return to FEATURE PLANNING

**WORKFLOW MODE CONFIGURATION:**

**EXECUTION MODES (Choose One):**
- **SINGLE ISSUE MODE (DEFAULT)**: Complete full workflow for one issue → Executive Summary → STOP
- **BATCH MODE (USER EXPLICITLY REQUESTS)**: When user explicitly asks to "solve all open issues" or "fix all issues":
  - **⚠️ INFINITE DURATION WARNING**: Batch mode typically runs indefinitely because playtest workflow discovers new issues
  - **🤖 FULLY AUTONOMOUS**: Batch mode NEVER pauses for user input unless manual review mode explicitly requested
  - **MANDATORY**: Apply workflow repeatedly until ALL issues are resolved
  - **AUTOMATIC PLAYTEST**: When repository becomes clean (zero issues), playtest workflow automatically triggers
  - **ISSUE REPLENISHMENT**: Playtest usually discovers new issues and files them as GitHub issues
  - **WORKFLOW CONTINUATION**: After each issue completion, immediately return to PHASE 1 (max-devops repository assessment) 
  - **RARE TERMINATION**: Batch only stops when playtest discovers ZERO issues (very rare)
  - **FINAL SUMMARY ONLY**: Executive Summary delivered only after playtest finds zero issues

**REVIEW MODES (Choose One - Independent of Execution Mode):**
- **AUTOMATIC REVIEW (DEFAULT)**: All agents complete review autonomously → workflow proceeds automatically
- **MANUAL REVIEW (USER EXPLICITLY REQUESTS)**: When user explicitly says "manual mode" or "manual review":
  - **USER FINAL REVIEW**: User performs final review after all agent reviews complete
  - **WORKFLOW PAUSE**: Workflow pauses after chris-architect review, waits for user input
  - **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED**: User has final approval authority before proceeding
  - **FINDINGS HANDBACK**: User findings are handed back to appropriate agents for immediate fixes
  - **WORKS WITH ANY EXECUTION MODE**: Manual review works in both single issue and batch modes

**VALID COMBINATIONS:**
- Single Issue + Automatic Review (DEFAULT)
- Single Issue + Manual Review  
- Batch Mode + Automatic Review
- Batch Mode + Manual Review
**PHASE 3: Architecture Documentation** - chris-architect updates DESIGN.md, creates detailed implementation plan, and conducts risk assessment
   - **Risk Assessment**: Identify technical, schedule, and quality risks with mitigation strategies
   - **Opportunity Analysis**: Identify performance, efficiency, and innovation opportunities

**PHASE 4: RED Phase** - georg-test-engineer writes failing tests (parallel: chris-architect refines details)
   - **COMMIT**: georg commits test suite and opens draft PR after completion

**PHASE 5: Implementation Phase** - **SERIAL EXECUTION (Docs-First)**
   - winny-technical-writer writes user documentation using test specifications (docs-first approach)
   - sergei-perfectionist-coder implements code + updates API/developer docs using winny's documentation as guide
   - **COMMIT**: max-devops commits both documentation and implementation atomically after both agents complete

**PHASE 6: Review Phase** - **SERIAL EXECUTION**
   - max-devops technical validation (FIRST REVIEWER - build/test/hygiene analysis) → immediate handback if critical issues
   - patrick-auditor code quality + security review → immediate handback if critical issues  
   - vicky-acceptance-tester user acceptance + UX validation → immediate handback if critical issues
   - chris-architect architecture alignment review → immediate handback if critical issues
   - **MANUAL REVIEW MODE ONLY** - User final review → immediate handback if critical issues
   - **CRITICAL HANDBACK PROTOCOL**: When sergei fixes critical findings, return to THE FIRST reviewer (max-devops) to restart entire review chain from beginning

**PHASE 7: Completion** - **COMBINED FINAL PHASE**
   - **max-devops**: Repository cleanup, CI validation, PR merge, working directory cleanup
   - **chris-architect**: Executive summary report to user

## PLAYTEST WORKFLOW (System Audit)

**When**: Clean repository state (all PRs merged, all issues closed)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive system exploration to discover defects and improvements that escaped normal review

**Protocol** (Serial execution):
1. **max-devops-engineer**: Repository health check, build system validation, CI verification, findings categorization
2. **SERIAL AUDIT (only if max confirms clean build state)**:
   - **Phase 2a**: patrick-auditor performs security audit, code quality review, technical debt identification
   - **Phase 2b**: vicky-acceptance-tester performs exhaustive user acceptance testing, stress testing, edge case exploration  
   - **Phase 2c**: chris-architect performs architecture review, design consistency validation, strategic assessment
3. **All agents**: File issues for discovered defects/improvements at appropriate severity levels
   - Labels: [CRITICAL], [IMPROVEMENT], [TECHNICAL-DEBT], [UX], [DOCS], [SECURITY]
4. **max-devops-engineer**: Ensure all findings are properly documented as GitHub issues
5. **CONDITIONAL CONTINUATION**: 
   - **SINGLE MODE (DEFAULT)**: After playtest completion → chris-architect delivers Executive Summary → STOP
   - **BATCH MODE (USER REQUESTS)**: After playtest completion → immediately continue with main development workflow using newly created issues → clean repository triggers new playtest → potentially infinite cycle

**Key Principles**:
- **AUDIT MINDSET**: Thorough exploration without time pressure of active development
- **ISSUE CREATION ENCOURAGED**: Build comprehensive backlog of improvements
- **max-devops RESPONSIBILITY**: Build operations, git hygiene, repository management only
- **CONDITIONAL CONTINUATION**: Only proceed to resolve discovered issues if user explicitly requests batch mode

**Communication Pattern:**
- **Streamlined Handoffs**: Direct task delegation without verbose explanations
- **Context Handoff**: `CONSTRAINTS: [limits] | DECISIONS: [choices] | BLOCKERS: [risks]`
- **Technical Data**: `BUILD: [status] | FINDINGS: [critical/major/minor] | ARTIFACTS: [key results]`

**Commit Protocol:**
- Each agent commits their own work immediately after completion
- ALL agents must follow strict git hygiene: manually specify files with `git add <file>`, NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`
- MANDATORY workspace cleanup after each task: remove temp files, artifacts (except build folders for faster rebuilds)
- Conventional Commits format: `<type>: <description>` 
- Imperative mood, no period, under 72 chars, one logical change per commit
- NO EMOJIS, NO ROBOT SIGNATURES - clean, precise commits only
- NEVER commit binary files, build artifacts, or temporary files

**Issue Management:**
- **"Fix Now (<30min) or File Issue"** decision protocol:
  - **CRITICAL findings** → Always fix immediately (required for progression)
  - **MAJOR/MINOR findings** → Fix now if <30min, otherwise create GitHub issue
  - **Issue labels**: [CRITICAL], [IMPROVEMENT], [TECHNICAL-DEBT], [UX], [DOCS]
- chris-architect owns issue lifecycle, triage, prioritization, closure decisions
- Never expand PR scope - file issues for scope creep
- Escalate complex blockers (>2hrs), architectural conflicts, unclear requirements to user

**Findings vs Issues Protocol:**
- **Findings** = Discovered during current PR review cycle (immediate attention)
- **Issues** = Filed for future work outside current PR scope
- **Critical findings** must be fixed before progression, cannot become issues
- **Major/Minor findings** can become issues if they require >30min work

**Reporting:**
- Every agent MUST deliver: **COMPLETED**, **OPEN ITEMS**, **LESSONS LEARNED**
- chris-architect delivers **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** at PR completion
- **LESSONS LEARNED** must include CLAUDE.md workflow improvement recommendations

## Core Principles

### Quality Policy Statement
**Our commitment**: Deliver computational physics-grade software through structured TDD workflows that exceed user expectations while maintaining zero-defect precision and continuous improvement.

### Quality Standards
- **Quality**: TDD, SOLID, KISS, SRP, DRY - no shortcuts, 100% completion
- **MVP Focus**: Deliver highest quality minimum viable product, resist feature creep and overengineering
- **Code Style**: 88 char limit, 4-space indent, self-documenting, no commented code
- **NO DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING**: Write clean, straightforward code without excessive error checking or validation
- **Workflow**: Plan through chris-architect, work on existing files in place
- **Fortran**: Use typename_t convention, empty associate blocks for warnings

### Immediate Cleanup Policy
- **NEVER KEEP OBSOLETE CODE OR DOCS**: No backup copies, no commented-out code, no "just in case" preservation
- **IMMEDIATE DELETION**: Remove obsolete code/docs immediately when updating, NEVER postpone cleanup
- **CHANGE OR DELETE**: Every line either serves current purpose or gets deleted - no middle ground
- **PROACTIVE CLEANUP**: Actively remove dead code, unused imports, obsolete documentation during every change
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This applies to all agents - sergei (code), winny (docs), patrick (review), all specialists

### Customer Focus
- **Primary Customer**: Repository owner/user requesting functionality
- **Customer Requirements**: Captured in GitHub issues and user acceptance criteria
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Measured through vicky-acceptance-tester validation and chris-architect executive summaries
- **Customer Communication**: Direct interaction ONLY when user explicitly requests manual review mode

## System Context
- **OS**: Arch Linux
- **GitHub**: krystophny
- **Fortran Rules**: 
  - No transfer for allocatables, use subroutines with intent(out), overload assignment operators
  - NEVER manually deallocate allocatable type instances - Fortran automatically deallocates when out of scope
  - Prefer move_alloc() when no copy is needed - transfers allocation without copying data
- If you encounter strange and flakey memory errors in Fortran, it could be because you allocated too large arrays or objects on the stack. NEVER fix this sith increasing stack size or moving stack to heap by compiler flags. ALWAYS fix it by using allocatable arrays or objects.
- NEVER use git add . or git add -A !! always manually specify which files to add and dont forget any and never commit binary files or artifacts
