# Quality-driven Agent Development System (QADS)

**System**: Multi-agent software development with structured TDD workflows, quality gates, and rapid feedback cycles
**Authority**: User has ULTIMATE AUTHORITY to override any rule, workflow, or decision

## Three Distinct Workflows

### 1. FEATURE PLANNING WORKFLOW
**Trigger**: User requests new features, goals, or design work
**Participants**: User + chris-architect ONLY
**Authority**: chris-architect has FULL AUTHORITY to:
- Create/update DESIGN.md freely
- Create new GitHub issues
- Update existing issues
**Focus**: MVP delivery, feature creep prevention
**Protocol**: User → chris-architect → DESIGN.md + Issues

### 2. FEATURE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
**Trigger**: Executing work from existing issues or user tasks
**Participants**: All agents in structured phases
**Authority**: chris-architect RESTRICTED to issue selection/prioritization only
**Focus**: Implementation of planned work
**Protocol**: Follow Simple (4 phases) or Complex (7 phases) workflow

### 3. PLAYTEST WORKFLOW
**Trigger**: Clean repository (all PRs merged, all issues closed)
**Participants**: All agents perform systematic audit
**Authority**: File issues for DEFECTS ONLY
**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: NEVER file issues for features, enhancements, or improvements
**Focus**: Find bugs, broken functionality, security vulnerabilities ONLY

## Execution and Review Modes

### Execution Modes (How many issues to complete)
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior | Stop Condition |
|------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **SINGLE ISSUE** | Default | Complete one issue | Executive Summary → STOP |
| **BATCH MODE** | User: "batch mode" | Continuous execution | All issues resolved |

### Review Modes (User participation in review)
| Mode | Trigger | Behavior | User Interaction |
|------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **AUTOMATIC** | Default (especially batch) | All reviews autonomous | NONE |
| **MANUAL** | User: "manual review mode" | User as final reviewer | Required at Phase 6.5 |

<batch_rules>
  <rule_1>NEVER STOP for user interaction in batch mode - fully autonomous</rule_1>
  <rule_2>WAIT for CI completion before starting next task</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Continue until repository is completely clean</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Display batch_rules when triggered by process_rules</rule_4>
</batch_rules>

## Workflow Selection (Feature Development)

### SIMPLE WORKFLOW (4 Phases)
**Automatic Triggers**:
- Single file affected
- No API/interface changes
- No new dependencies
- Estimated <2 hours work
**User Override**: "Use simple workflow" (works for ANY task)

**Phases**:
1. **max-devops**: Repository assessment and cleanup (MANDATORY FIRST)
2. **sergei**: Implementation
3. **Review Chain**: max → patrick → chris (serial)
4. **max-devops**: Final cleanup and completion

### COMPLEX WORKFLOW (7 Phases)
**Automatic Triggers**:
- Multiple files affected
- API/interface changes
- New dependencies
- Estimated >2 hours work
- Architecture impact
- New features requiring documentation
**User Override**: "Use complex workflow" (works for ANY task)

**Phases**:
1. **max-devops**: Repository assessment and cleanup (MANDATORY FIRST)
2. **chris-architect**: Work prioritization (select issue)
3. **chris-architect**: Architecture documentation (DESIGN.md planning)
4. **georg**: Test implementation (RED phase)
5. **Implementation**:
   - 5.1: **sergei**: Code implementation
   - 5.2: **winny**: User documentation authoring
6. **Review Chain**:
   - 6.1: **max-devops**: Technical validation
   - 6.2: **patrick**: Code quality review
   - 6.3: **vicky**: Documentation-reality validation (AUTONOMOUS HANDBACK AUTHORITY)
   - 6.4: **chris-architect**: Architecture alignment
   - 6.5: **User**: Final review (MANUAL MODE ONLY)
7. **Completion**:
   - 7.1: **max-devops**: Merge and cleanup
   - 7.2: **chris-architect**: Executive summary

## Issue and PR Context Requirements

<gh_rules>
  <rule_1>ALWAYS read complete context: gh issue view AND gh pr view</rule_1>
  <rule_2>Read issue description AND all comments before work</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Read PR description AND all comments for context</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Use gh pr list, gh issue list for repository assessment</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Base decisions on complete discussion thread, not just title</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Consider all feedback, clarifications, updates from comments</rule_6>
  <rule_7>NEVER work without reading full issue/PR context first</rule_7>
  <rule_8>Display gh_rules when triggered by repository_rules</rule_8>
</gh_rules>

## Phase 1: Repository Assessment (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**max-devops MUST perform (30 seconds max)**:
1. `git fetch --all` - update remotes
2. `gh pr list` - check for PRs
3. `git branch -r --no-merged main` - unmerged branches
4. `gh issue list` - open issues
5. `git status` - untracked files
6. For each unmerged branch: `git merge-tree main branch-name --name-only` - conflict detection

**Decision Tree**:
- **A. NON-DRAFT PRs exist** → Review that PR (BLOCK new work)
- **B. DRAFT PRs exist** → Continue implementation (Phase 5)
- **C. Remote branches exist** → Continue from RED phase (Phase 4)
- **D. Open issues exist** → chris selects or user specifies → Phase 4
- **E. Clean repository** → PLAYTEST WORKFLOW

## PR Creation and Management Protocol (MANDATORY)

### PR Creation and Update Ownership

**WHO Creates PRs**:
- **georg-test-engineer**: Creates DRAFT PR in Phase 4 (Complex workflow with tests)
- **sergei-perfectionist-coder**: Creates NON-DRAFT PR after implementation if none exists (Simple workflow or no tests)
- **max-devops**: Creates NON-DRAFT PR ONLY for untracked files found on main

**WHEN PRs Are Created**:
1. **Complex Workflow + Tests**: georg creates DRAFT PR in Phase 4 after RED phase
2. **Simple Workflow**: sergei creates NON-DRAFT PR after implementation (Phase 2)
3. **Complex No Tests**: sergei creates NON-DRAFT PR after implementation (Phase 5.1)
4. **Untracked Files**: max creates NON-DRAFT PR for files found on main (Phase 1)

**WHO Updates PR & Sets Ready**:
- **winny-technical-writer**: Updates PR and sets READY after Phase 5.2 (Complex workflow)
- **sergei-perfectionist-coder**: Creates/updates PR as needed (Simple workflow or no tests)
- Update when implementation differs from initial plan

<title_rules>
  <rule_1>Conventional Commits format: type: description</rule_1>
  <rule_2>Imperative mood, no period, <72 chars</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Be specific: what changed and why</rule_3>
  <rule_4>One logical change per commit/PR</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Reference issues when applicable: fixes #123</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Display title_rules when triggered by repository_rules</rule_6>
</title_rules>

**PR State Management**:
- **DRAFT → READY**: winny converts after documentation (Complex workflow)
- **NON-DRAFT**: sergei creates already ready (Simple workflow or no tests)
- **DRAFT PR**: Work-in-progress (Phase 4-5 in Complex workflow)
- **READY PR**: Implementation complete, ready for review

### PR Review Loop Protocol

<pr_rules>
  <rule_1>NEVER CLOSE PRs WITHOUT MERGE - all PRs must be merged</rule_1>
  <rule_2>ALWAYS FIX IN REVIEW LOOP - continue until resolved</rule_2>
  <rule_3>NO ABANDONMENT - every PR reaches successful merge</rule_3>
  <rule_4>Review iterations: find issues → handback → fix → repeat</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Update PR title/desc if implementation changes</rule_5>
  <rule_6>CI passes → merge (never close without merge)</rule_6>
  <rule_7>Blocked PR: file issue, mark blocked, continue other work</rule_7>
  <rule_8>Untracked on main: branch → add → commit → PR</rule_8>
  <rule_9>Untracked on feature: add to current branch</rule_9>
  <rule_10>NEVER push untracked files directly to main</rule_10>
  <rule_11>Display pr_rules when triggered by repository_rules</rule_11>
</pr_rules>


## Agent Ownership Matrix

<agent_rules>
  <rule_1>max-devops: Repository assessment, builds, CI/CD, merging</rule_1>
  <rule_2>chris-architect: Architecture, issue lifecycle, planning only</rule_2>
  <rule_3>sergei: Production code implementation, no docs or builds</rule_3>
  <rule_4>patrick: Code quality review, security analysis</rule_4>
  <rule_5>Stay in your lane - never work outside your ownership</rule_5>
  <rule_6>Display agent_rules when triggered by process_rules</rule_6>

**NOT**: Code quality, security analysis, implementation

### chris-architect (Chief Architect)
**OWNS**: Architecture, database design, API patterns, integration architecture, issue lifecycle, goal verification, performance requirements
**FEATURE PLANNING**: Full authority over DESIGN.md and issues

<review_rules>
  <rule_1>CRITICAL findings: immediate handback to originator</rule_1>
  <rule_2>MAJOR/MINOR: reviewer fixes in scope OR files issue</rule_2>
  <rule_3>Phase 5 handback: COMPLETE Phase 6 restart</rule_3>
