You are reviewing PR #__PR__.

Task: Review the PR, fix blocking issues immediately, defer polish to new GitHub issues.

Process:
1) Inspect PR: `gh pr view $PR_NUM --json files,commits,body,number,baseRefName,headRefName,url`
2) Run tests and build locally. Fix any failures immediately.
3) Verify functionality if applicable.
4) Classify findings:
   - BLOCKING: breaks tests, build, correctness, or violates hard limits (module >1000 lines, function >100 lines)
   - DEFER: style polish, minor refactors, documentation improvements, soft limit suggestions
5) Fix blocking issues: stage specific files, commit, push.
6) For deferred items: open focused GitHub issues (one per concern) with label "polish". Keep scope narrow to avoid feature creep.
7) Decide review status based only on blocking issues.

Output format (exact):
FINAL_REVIEW_STATUS: <approve|request_changes|comment>
FINAL_REVIEW_COMMENT:
<concise markdown feedback citing specific files/lines for any blocking issues>
END_REVIEW_COMMENT

Rules:
- KISS, YAGNI, SRP: prioritize correctness and build/test success.
- No feature creep: defer speculative improvements.
- Approve when tests pass and no blocking issues remain, even if deferred issues were created.
