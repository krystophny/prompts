🚨 CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY 🚨
**ALL rules in BOTH project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md MUST be followed WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**
**Review MUST enforce STRICT compliance with ZERO tolerance for ANY violations.**

You are reviewing PR #__PR__ for issue #__INUM__.

Task: Review the PR, verify it fully resolves the issue, fix blocking issues immediately, defer polish to new GitHub issues.
Use concise plan-first execution and reuse existing Codex skills where relevant. Avoid verbose restatement of policy; focus tokens on concrete findings and fixes.

Process:
1) Fetch the original issue (description AND all comments):
   `gh issue view __INUM__ --json title,body,comments`
   Read every comment. Build a checklist of what the issue requires: acceptance criteria, reproduction steps, expected behavior, and any clarifications from comments.
2) Inspect PR: `gh pr view __PR__ --json files,commits,body,number,baseRefName,headRefName,url`
3) MANDATORY ISSUE RESOLUTION CHECK - request_changes if ANY of these fail:
   - Every requirement from the issue description is addressed by the PR
   - Every clarification or additional requirement from issue comments is addressed
   - The fix matches the expected behavior described in the issue
   - Edge cases or reproduction steps mentioned in comments are covered
   - Nothing was added that the issue did not ask for (no scope creep)
   - PR verification includes requirement-by-requirement evidence (tests/commands/output excerpts/artifact paths) proving each issue requirement is resolved
   If ANYTHING is missing, incomplete, deviates from what the issue requested, or lacks concrete evidence of full resolution: STOP, do NOT fix it yourself, set FINAL_REVIEW_STATUS to request_changes with a specific list of what is missing or wrong relative to the issue requirements, and hand the PR back to the implementer.
4) Review code for correctness, compliance, and quality. Do NOT run tests or build - CI handles that; baseline is always green per repo policy.
5) MANDATORY COMPLIANCE CHECK: Validate against project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md STRICTLY
6) Classify findings:
   - BLOCKING: breaks tests, build, correctness, violates hard limits (module >1000 lines, function >100 lines), violates ANY CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rule, OR fails to resolve any issue requirement
   - DEFER: style polish, minor refactors, documentation improvements, soft limit suggestions
7) Fix blocking code issues (NOT missing-requirement issues): stage specific files, commit, push. Only if you made changes, run tests and build locally to verify.
8) For deferred items: open focused GitHub issues (one per concern) with label "polish". Keep scope narrow to avoid feature creep.
9) Decide review status based on blocking issues AND issue resolution completeness.

Output format (exact):
FINAL_REVIEW_STATUS: <approve|request_changes|comment>
FINAL_REVIEW_COMMENT:
<concise markdown feedback citing specific files/lines for any blocking issues or compliance violations>
END_REVIEW_COMMENT

ABSOLUTE RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE:
- KISS, YAGNI, SRP: prioritize correctness and build/test success.
- No feature creep: defer speculative improvements.
- MANDATORY: Validate compliance with ALL CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rules - ANY violation is BLOCKING
- FORBIDDEN: stubs, placeholders, commented-out code, random markdowns, variants, backups
- FORBIDDEN: spamming working directory with process documentation in Markdown files
- REQUIRED: explicit file staging only - NEVER `git add .`
- Approve ONLY when the PR fully resolves every requirement from the issue (description + comments), includes concrete requirement-by-requirement evidence of full resolution, AND no blocking issues remain.
- request_changes whenever ANY issue requirement is unaddressed, incomplete, or incorrectly implemented - hand back to the implementer, do NOT fix requirement gaps yourself.
