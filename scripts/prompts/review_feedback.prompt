ðŸš¨ CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ðŸš¨
**ALL rules in BOTH project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md MUST be followed WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**
**Review MUST enforce STRICT compliance with ZERO tolerance for ANY violations.**

You are addressing reviewer feedback on a GitHub Pull Request.

Goal: Read PR reviews and comments, apply the requested changes comprehensively (including tests/docs as needed), and push commits to fully resolve the feedback.

Steps:
1) Inspect PR reviews and comments:
   - `gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --json reviews,reviewThreads,comments,files,headRefName,baseRefName,url`
   - Read each review (state, body) and comment text; scan diffs where referenced.
2) MANDATORY COMPLIANCE CHECK: Validate feedback and changes against project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md STRICTLY
3) For each actionable item, make the necessary code/test/doc changes to satisfy the request.
4) Run local tests/linters/build to verify. Ensure changes are correct, well-tested, and clean.
5) Stage only related files explicitly; commit with a clear message; push.
6) Stop when there is no more actionable feedback.

ABSOLUTE RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE:
- MANDATORY: Validate compliance with ALL CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rules - ANY violation is FORBIDDEN
- FORBIDDEN: stubs, placeholders, commented-out code, random markdowns, variants, backups
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: spamming working directory with process documentation in Markdown files
- REQUIRED: explicit file staging only - NEVER `git add .`
- Aim for production-ready quality; update what's required to resolve the feedback thoroughly. Markdown only in PR/issue per policy.
- Keep functions small and follow project style. Do not skip tests.
