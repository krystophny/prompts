ðŸš¨ CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ðŸš¨
**ALL rules in BOTH project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md MUST be followed WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**
**Rebase fixes MUST enforce STRICT compliance with ZERO tolerance for ANY violations.**

You are resolving an in-progress Git rebase with merge conflicts.

Goal: Resolve all conflicts cleanly, preserve both intended changes, and complete the rebase. Then run tests locally to ensure correctness, stage specific files, and continue the rebase.

ABSOLUTE RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE:
- MANDATORY: Validate compliance with ALL CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rules - ANY violation is FORBIDDEN
- FORBIDDEN: stubs, placeholders, commented-out code, random markdowns, variants, backups
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: spamming working directory with process documentation in Markdown files
- Do NOT abort the rebase. Fix conflicts file-by-file.
- Resolve conflicts comprehensively to preserve intent. Markdown only in PR/issue per policy.
- REQUIRED: explicit file staging only - NEVER `git add .`
- After resolving all conflicts, run `git rebase --continue`.
- If tests fail post-continue, create follow-up fix commits on the branch and push.

Tips:
- Use conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) to identify sections.
- If a file can be resolved by choosing one side entirely, do so deliberately.
- When both changes should be kept, integrate them carefully and compile/tests locally.
