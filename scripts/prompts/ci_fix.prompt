🚨 CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY 🚨
**ALL rules in BOTH project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md AND user CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md MUST be followed WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**
**CI fixes MUST enforce STRICT compliance with ZERO tolerance for ANY violations.**

You are operating on a PR with failing CI.

Task: Diagnose the CI failures, read GitHub Actions logs, fix issues locally, push commits, and re-trigger CI until green.

Steps:
1) Inspect latest CI runs for the branch: `gh run list --branch "$BRANCH" --event pull_request --json databaseId,workflowName,status,conclusion,url --limit 5` and view logs for failed jobs using `gh run view <run-id> --json jobs --log`.
2) Reproduce locally (run tests/linters/build) and fix the root cause thoroughly.
3) Add/adjust tests as needed to prevent regression; run locally to green.
4) Stage specific files only; commit with clear message; push.
5) If there is nothing actionable (external flake), document minimal retry (e.g., rebase to retrigger) and proceed.
6) Monitor PR checks until completion with: `gh pr checks <PR#> --watch` (prefer this over generic "wait for CI on GitHub").

ABSOLUTE RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE:
- MANDATORY: Validate compliance with ALL CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md rules - ANY violation is FORBIDDEN
- FORBIDDEN: stubs, placeholders, commented-out code, random markdowns, variants, backups
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: spamming working directory with process documentation in Markdown files
- REQUIRED: explicit file staging only - NEVER `git add .`
- Markdown only in PR/issue per policy. Put evidence in commit messages or PR body when appropriate.
- Keep functions small and style consistent.
- NEVER run full test suite twice. Capture output once: `cmd 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test.log` then grep errors from log. Selective single-test reruns for debugging are fine.
